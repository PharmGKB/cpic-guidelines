# cpic-guidelines - CPIC Guideline Documents

This repository is a collection of [CPIC](https://www.cpicpgx.org) drug dosing guideline publications and their supplemental data. 


## Organization

All guidelines are grouped into folders named for the drug or drug classification discussed. Each guideline will have an initial publication and could possibly have an *update* publication as well. Each publication is stored in a folder named for the year of publication. These folders contain the publication itself (named using the [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) identifier) and any supplemental data.

Files stored in this repo will be available on the CPIC web server at the following URL:
```
https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/<path-to-file>
```

You can browse the currently deployed guideline files at [https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/](https://cpicpgx.org/content/guideline/publication/)
